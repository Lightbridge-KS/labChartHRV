## Tutorial

-   How to import **LabChart's HRV report file** (`.txt`) into a **tidy tibble** with 1 subject per rows.

## Export HRV report file

After you've analysed the HRV data in LabChart, follow these steps to export HRV report:

Go to menu `HRV` -\> `Export Report...` -\> save file as `.txt`

Open that file, it should look like this:

![](img/hrv-rep-ex1.png){width="700"}

As you can see, the text file is slightly formatted and store data in key-value pairs (mostly).

How to transform it so that a data analysis can be performed?

To process this data for further analysis, one approach is to convert it to a table-like data structure which, in `R`, is a **data frame** (or [tibble](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/tibbles.html)). The design of this data frame should be [**tidy**](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/tidy-data.html), meaning column names are variables, and each rows represent a single subject. (As in this example, it should be converted to a 1 row data frame.)

It takes time and effort to manually transforms this into a table which can be even harder when the number of subject grows.

That's why I've build this package!

## Read HRV report file

**`read_HRV_reports()`** read and transform LabChart's HRV report file (`.txt`) to a tidy tibble.

The first argument (`file`) is a **path** to either *single* HRV report file or *folder* containing multiple HRV report file, the latter case should be more useful to you.

```{r setup}
library(labChartHRV)
```

```{r path_hrv}
# Path to a folder containing example HRV report text files
path_hrv <- labChartHRV_example("HRV")
path_hrv
```

There are `r length(dir(path_hrv))` HRV report `.txt` files in this folder.

```{r }
dir(path_hrv)
```

Now, just supply the path to the folder to import it.

```{r hrv_tbl}
# Read In
hrv_tbl <- read_HRV_reports(path_hrv)
hrv_tbl
```

(**Note:** Internally `read_HRV_reports()` use `readtext::readtext()` to read textual data. I've set the text encoding to `UTF-16LE`. If you found that the output looks abnormal try changing text encoding via argument `encoding`.)

`hrv_tbl` has `r ncol(hrv_tbl)` columns and `r nrow(hrv_tbl)` rows. Column names correspond to each fields of the HRV report, and each rows correspond to each HRV report files.

```{r}
# Column Names
names(hrv_tbl)
```

The description of each columns is stored in `HRV_vars_desc` data frame.

```{r HRV_vars_desc}
HRV_vars_desc
```

## Parse HRV report

**`parse_HRV_reports()`** is a lower-level function that *parse* HRV report from **character vector** to a data frame.

### Read Manually

First, you need to read HRV report in to character vector using any text reading engine of your choice.

```{r hrv_chr}
# Path to an HRV report text file
path_hrv1 <- labChartHRV_example("HRV/file1.txt")

# Read into character vector, I use `{readtext}`
hrv_chr <- readtext::readtext(path_hrv1, 
                              encoding = "UTF-16LE")$text
# For nice printing
glue::as_glue(hrv_chr) 
```

### Parse to Data Frame

Now parse the character vector to a data frame.

```{r}
parse_HRV_reports(hrv_chr)
```

Since I've import only 1 HRV report into a character vector of **length 1**, the resulting data frame has only **1 row**.

However, you can supply HRV report character vector which has \> 1 length, and the resulting data frame would have multiple rows corresponding to each HRV reports.


## Selection Helper

`{labChartHRV}` comes with a helper for select HRV time-and frequency-domain variables.

`HRV_vars_domain` is a list with 2 elements:

-   `time`: contains character vector of time-domain variables.

-   `freq`: contains character vector of frequency-domain variables.

For example

```{r setup-2, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(dplyr)
```

```{r}
vars <- HRV_vars_domain
str(vars)
```

Select HRV time-domain variables.

```{r}
hrv_tbl %>% 
  select(Name, vars$time)
```
