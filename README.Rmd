> **R package :package: for LabChart's Heart Rate Variability Data**

# Overview

**`{labChartHRV}`** is an open-source software package written in [R programming language](https://www.r-project.org).

It is an R package which contains functions for data import and manipulation of [LabChart's HRV module](https://www.adinstruments.com/products/hrv).

**Functionality**: currently there is 1

-   Import and transform LabChart's HRV report file (`.txt`) into a tibble (data frame).

(If you want to collaborate and add more functions, please contact me at [kittipos.sir\@mahidol.edu](mailto:kittipos.sir@mahidol.edu))

# Installation

You can install the development version of labChartHRV from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

-   (If you haven't already), install `{remotes}` package by:

``` r
install.packages("remotes")
```

-   Install `{labChartHRV}` package by:

``` r
remotes::install_github("Lightbridge-KS/labChartHRV")
```

# Usage

```{r}
library(labChartHRV)
```

`{labChartHRV}` contains simulated example data that can be accessed by `labChartHRV_example()`.

```{r}
# Show example data that available in this package
labChartHRV_example()
```

Currently, there is 1 type of example data which is LabChart's HRV report file.

## Module 1: Read LabChart's HRV Report

> This module reads and transforms **LabChart's HRV report file** (`.txt`) into a **tidy tibble** with 1 subject per rows.

### Introduction

After exported LabChart's HRV of 1 subject into a report text file, it should look like this:

![](man/figures/hrv-rep-ex1.png)

As you can see, the text file is slightly formatted and store data in key-value pairs (mostly).

> How to transform it so that a data analysis can be performed?

To process this data for further analysis, one approach is to convert it to a table-like data structure which, in `R`, is a **data frame** (or [tibble](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/tibbles.html)). The design of this data frame should be [**tidy**](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/tidy-data.html), meaning column names are variables, and each rows represent a single subject. (As in this example, it should be converted to a 1 row data frame.)

It takes time and effort to manually transforms this into a table which can be even harder when the number of subject grows.

Functions in this module will **automate** this process.

### Read HRV report file

`read_HRV_reports()` read and transform LabChart's HRV report file (`.txt`) to a tidy tibble.

The first argument (`file`) is a **path** to either *single* HRV report file or *folder* containing multiple HRV report file, the latter case should be more useful to you.

```{r path_hrv}
# Path to a folder containing example HRV report text files
path_hrv <- labChartHRV_example("HRV")
path_hrv
```

There are `r length(dir(path_hrv))` HRV report `.txt` files in this folder.

```{r}
dir(path_hrv)
```

Now, just supply the path to the folder.

```{r}
# Read In
hrv_tbl <- read_HRV_reports(path_hrv)
hrv_tbl
```

`hrv_tbl` has `r ncol(hrv_tbl)` columns and `r nrow(hrv_tbl)` rows. Column names correspond to each fields of the HRV report, and each rows correspond to each HRV report files.

```{r}
# Column Names
names(hrv_tbl)
```
